## Python Networking #0
## Learning Objectives:
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What a URL is
* What HTTP is
* How to read a URL
* The scheme for a HTTP URL
* What a domain name is
* What a sub-domain is
* How to define a port number in a URL
* What a query string is
* What an HTTP request is
* What an HTTP response is
* What HTTP headers are
* What the HTTP message body is
* What an HTTP request method is
* What an HTTP response status code is
* What an HTTP Cookie is
* How to make a request with cURL
* What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level)

## General requirements:
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All scripts tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All your Bash scripts should be exactly 3 lines long (`wc -l file` should print 3)
* All your files must be executable
* The first line of all your bash files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
* All `curl` commands must have the option `-s` (silent mode)
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
* The first line of all your Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)

## Tasks:
### [0. cURL body size](./0-body_size.sh)
Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response

* The size must be displayed in bytes
* You have to use `curl`

```
root@4653e508fb2e:/alx-higher_level_programming/0x10-python-network_0# ./0-body_size.sh 0.0.0.0:5000
10
root@4653e508fb2e:/alx-higher_level_programming/0x10-python-network_0#
```

### [1. cURL to the end](./1-body.sh)
Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a `GET` request to the URL, and displays the body of the response

* Display only body of a `200` status code response
* You have to use `curl`

### [2. cURL Method](./2-delete.sh)
Write a Bash script that sends a `DELETE` request to the URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response

* You have to use `curl`

### [3. cURL only methods](./3-methods.sh)
Write a Bash script that takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept.

* You have to use `curl`

### [4. cURL headers](./4.header.sh)
Write a Bash script that takes in a URL as an argument, sends a `GET` request to the URL, and displays the body of the response

* A header variable `X-School-User-Id` must be sent with the value `98`
* You have to use `curl`

### [5. cURL POST parameters](./5-post_params.sh)
Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a `POST` request to the passed URL, and displays the body of the response

* A variable `email` must be sent with the value `test@gmail.com`
* A variable `subject` must be sent with the value `I will always be here for PLD`
* You have to use `curl`

### [6. Find a peak](./6-peak.py)
**Technical interview preparation**:

* You are not allowed to google anything
* Whiteboard first

Write a function that finds **a peak** in a list of unsorted integers.

* Prototype: `def find_peak(list_of_integers):`
* You are not allowed to import any module
* Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you donâ€™t need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
* `6-peak.py` must contain the function
* `6-peak.txt` must contain the complexity of your algorithm: `O(log(n))`, `O(n)`, `O(nlog(n))` or `O(n2)`
* **Note**: there may be more than one peak in the list
